# easy-sign-in-ios
An open-sourced iOS app that provides an easier way to sign in to events.

# Sign In! (v1)

Sign In! is an iOS app that was born out of an inconvenience that I noticed clubs facing when it comes to tracking
attendance at their meetings. I wanted to provide an easier way for people to sign in to events and for clubs to 
keep record of their club engagement. This is the first version of my efforts.  

Backend Implementation
 * Sign In Server v1: https://github.com/lucyxubroad/signin-backend
 
 # Installation
 
 I used [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org "CocoaPods") for my dependency manager. This should be installed before 
 continuing.
 
 Clone the project with
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/lucyxubroad/confessions-ios-app.git
 ```
 
 After cloning the project, cd into the new directory and install dependencies with
 ```
 pod install
 ```

 Open the SignIn Xcode workspace, SignIn.xcworkspace.
